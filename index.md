## Welcome to Owl-ProjX

We are a newly founded web


This is a temporary website for my web development.

Note to self: Look up markdown Syntax

#Is this bigger?

### Some cute lil box thingy

```markdown
You can write stuff here like code and insert photos etc

```



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jojojoseph00/owlprojX/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Some image outside the box

Let's try this here

How did it go?

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block



# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jojojoseph00/owlprojX/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
