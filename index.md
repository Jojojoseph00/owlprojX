##  WELCOME TO OWL-PROX

We are a young web development company founded by fresh Computer Science graduates with the aim of democratising web development.

_Owl-ProjX_ is born from the frustration of witnessing pompous elitism affect computer science. While computer scientists' aim is to advance progress into the lives of all, we live in a world where the skilled are charging ridiculously their clients for technologies now essential to any business. That explains how some businesses pay up to $70,000 for websites that actually cost a third of that.

##  WEB DEVELOPER VS WEB DESIGNER

There is a fundamental difference between a web developing and a web designing firm. The latter is solely focused on the front end aspect of your website. This means that they strictly


In essence, web design refers to both the aesthetic portion of the website and it’s usability. Web designers use various design programs such as Adobe Photoshop to create the layout and other visual elements of the website.

Web Developers on the other hand, take a website design and actually make a functioning website from it. Web developers use HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and other programming languages to bring to life the design files.

Web developers, sometimes called programmers, take the design created and build a fully functioning website. To put it (very) simply, think of the design as a non-interactive “picture” of a website. Developers take that design and break it up into it’s components. They then either use just HTML or a more dynamic approach incorporating programming languages such as PHP to develop the various website pages. More advanced web developers may choose to utilize a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress or Joomla in order to streamline development and allow clients an easy way to maintain and update their website.

Web developers may convert a static layout into a dynamic website by using image and content sliders, active states for links and buttons, and other interactive elements

Small- and medium-sized companies looking for a website or a re-design of their existing website may be confused by the blurred lines surrounding the terms “Web Design” and “Web Development.” Although there are individuals that are able to do both, many companies have dedicated designers which create the website layout and then hand the design files over to a programmer who completes the development stage. Hopefully this article will help clear up the common misconception that design and development are one in the same.
