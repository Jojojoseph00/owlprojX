## Welcome to Owl-ProjX

We are a young web development company founded by fresh Computer Science graduates with the aim of democratising web development.
Owl-ProjX is born from the frustration of witnessing pompous elitism affect computer science. While computer scientists' aim is to advance progress into the lives of all, we live in a world where the skilled are charging ridiculously their clients for technologies now essential to any business.

This is a temporary website for my web development.

Note to self: Look up markdown Syntax

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jojojoseph00/owlprojX/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
